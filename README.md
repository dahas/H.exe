# Hexe

The purpose of Hexe is to rebrand the "electron.exe" in a simple manner. It is a GUI that uses Electrons "rcedit" in the background.

## Setup

Download the installer from [here](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Notes

##### Windows compliant application icons

Using a websites favicon as icon for the executable is not enough. It wonÂ´t scale correctly. Therefore the icon must contain multiple sizes. If you are not yet familiar with such icons, please search on the internet to find out how to create them.

##### Renaming the Exe

When you apply your changes the executable will be renamed according the value of "OriginalFilename". So better check twice that it is named correctly.
