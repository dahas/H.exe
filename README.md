# Hexe

The purpose of Hexe is to rebrand the "electron.exe" in a simple manner. It is a GUI that uses Electrons "rcedit" in the background.

## Setup

The easiest way to setup and use Hexe is with the [installer](http://www.martinwolf.info/products/hexe/hexe.zip). Alternatively you can download the resources from here and run "h.exe".

## Notes

#### Windows compliant application icons

Using a websites favicon as icon for the executable is not enough. It wonÂ´t scale correctly. Therefore the icon must contain multiple sizes. If you are not yet familiar with such icons, please search on the internet to find out how to create them.

#### Renaming the Exe

When you apply your changes the executable will be renamed according the value of "OriginalFilename". So better check twice that the value of this field is set correctly.
